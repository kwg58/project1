# Project 1 Evaluation
[inline code comments](https://github.com/kwg58/project1/pull/1/files)
## Planning / Process / Submission
**2: Performing**
>Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues.

I'm always a sucker for a good readme. Got a good idea of the process/work that went into your project by reading through yours. Moving forward, I would also include some practical information in there, like installation/running instructions for the app.

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

Great job with this. Aside from a bug where I'm able to click multiple tiles in a turn, this game works very well. Your Javascript looks great too - take a look at the inline code comments I made via the link above. I read your question about CSS positioning and I'm having some trouble myself adjusting the CSS to get it to display properly. I'll keep working on it.

## Code Quality
**1: Progressing**
>Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

The code itself looks great. The one thing that made navigating through your a code a bit difficult was the different HTML, CSS and JS files you had. I had to double check to make sure that your test files were the ones responsible for powering your game. Moving forward, I would remove any files you are not using from the master / gh-pages branch of your project. If you'd like to keep these, consider moving them into a separate branch.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

I really enjoyed the project's theme. Great personal touch!

I got a few warnings/errors when running your HTML/CSS through validators. Try it out yourself. They should be quick fixes!
